##### कर्तृ
The कर्तृ denotes the person, thing, place, or even abstract concept that carries out the action or experiences the state or condition expressed by the धातु. The कर्तृ of a Sanskrit sentence is always the agent of the action, regardless of whether the sentence is “active” or “passive.”

##### कर्मन्‌
The immediate recipient of the force of an action is called the कर्मन्‌ or direct object.

##### सकर्मक and अकर्मक घातु-s
Transitive roots are said to be सकर्मकधातु-s (roots with a direct object) while intransitive roots are called अकर्मकधातु-s (roots without a direct object). Though verbs of motion are considered अकर्मकधातु, the goals of the motion are treated as direct objects for declension.

##### निपात
The particle स्म, when it appears after a लट् form, makes of the form a simple past tense.
The particle इति functions as a quotation mark immediately after the speech, thought, or idea quoted. इति, then, has the function of setting off independent sentences within sentences.
The particle अपि, when it is the first word of the sentence, turns a declarative sentence into an interrogative sentence. Such questions can be answered with either 'yes' or 'no'.

##### Adjectives

###### Pronominal Adjectives
Certain adjectives decline like pronouns. These include अन्य, एक, पर, पूर्व, and सर्व.
The paradigms of these adjectives are exactly like that of demonstrative pronouns in all three genders except that of all of them only अन्य shows the ending -त्‌ in the प्रथमा and द्वितीया, एक॰ of the नपुंसक॰.

##### Adverbs
##### Forming Adverbs from Nouns and Adjectives
Nouns may be used adverbially by declining them in the accusative singular.
Adjectives may be used adverbially by declining them in the instrumental singular. #todo

###### Interrogative Adverbs
Interrogative adverbs are used to replace a particular part of speech and turn the sentence into a question. These always begin with क्.

###### Relative Adverbs
Subordinate clauses are clauses that cannot stand alone as a sentence. Relative subordinate clauses require relative adverbs or pronouns. These always begin with य्.

###### Correlative Adverbs
Correlative clauses are independent clauses that 'complete' relative clauses to form complex sentences. Correlative clauses require correlative adverbs or pronouns. Except प्र॰ एक॰ पुं and स्त्री॰ सः and सा, all these begin with त्.

###### Formation
These adverbs are formed by prefixing क्, य्, or त् to the appropriate ending. The resulting adverbs are indeclinable. 

The endings and their general meanings are -
॰थम्/था - manner (कथम्, यथा, तथा)
॰तः - source / origin (time, place, etc.) (कुतः, यतः, ततः)
॰दा - time (कदा, यदा, तदा)
॰त्र - place (कुत्र, यत्र, तत्र)

Apart from these, there are also the following important relative-correlative pairs -
यदि (if) and तर्हि (then)
यावत् (as long as, to the extent that) and तावत्  (so long, to the extent that)

###### Additional adverbs
These endings can also be added to other pronominal stems such as अन्य, एक, and सर्व

##### Negation
A verbal phrase can be negated by using the negative particle न, or मा if they are in लोट्.
Nominals can be negated by prefixing them with अ, or अन् if they begin with a vowel.
