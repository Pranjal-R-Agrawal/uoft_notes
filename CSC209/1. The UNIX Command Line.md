##### Basic Commands and flags
- `cat`
	- Outputs the contents of a file
- `ls`
	- Lists the contents of a directory
	- Does not report files whose names begin with a dot, unless the `−a` flag is used
- `echo`
	- Outputs what is passed as arguments
	- Takes any number of inputs and outputs them separated by spaces
	- `-n`
		- Flag to not output the terminating newline
	- Example `echo -n This is a sentence
- `mkdir`
	- Creates a directory
- `rmdir`
	- Removes a directory
	- Only works if the directory is empty
- `rm`
	- Removes a file
	- `-r`
		- Flag to recursively remove all files in a directory and then the directory
	- `-i`
		- Flag to check before removing
	- `\`
		- Prefix to bypass aliases
	- `-f`
		- Flag to suppress queries and error messages
- `cd`
	- Changes the current directory
	- The argument can be both relative or absolute path name
	- Takes you to the home directory if no argument is passed
- `pwd`
	- Outputs the absolute path name of the current directory
- `cp`
	- Copies files
- `mv`
	- Moves and renames files
- `sed`
	- It is a stream editor
	- It performs transformations on the data as it goes by, like a filter, without modifying the file on disk
	- `s` command
		- It does a search and replace, but using the unix "regular expression" syntax
		- Syntax - The 's' command letter is followed by a slash , then the search string, then a slash, then the replacement string, then another slash, then any option key letters
		- Example `sed 's/\(.*\) \(.*\)/\2, \1/' composers.txt`
- `sort`
	- Sorts the input
	- `-k`
		- Flag to determine which key field to sort with
- `>`
	- Redirects standard output into a file
- `|`
	- Redirects the standard output of a command into the input of another
	- Example `sort -f -k2 composers.txt | sed 's/\(.*\) \(.*\)/\2, \1/'`
- `grep`
	- Outputs lines that match a pattern
- `tr`
	- Does character-level substitution, e.g. change all 'x's to 'y's.
- `head`, `tail`
	- Outputs first/last _n_ lines of a file
	- Example `head -5 composers.txt`
- `cmp`
	- Compares files in a byte-oriented way
- `diff`
	- Compares files in a text-file oriented way
- `comm`
	- Shows lines in common between two files
	- `-1`
		- Flag to suppress printing of column 1, lines only in file1
	- `-2`
		- Flag to suppress printing of column 2, lines only in file2
	- `-3`
		- Flag to suppress printing of column 3, lines common to both
	- `-i`
		- Flag for case insensitive comparison of lines
- `join`
	- Does a database join of two files
	- The files must be sorted by the key field
- `test`
	- Integers
		- `-lt`
			- Flag to check if two integer_1 is algebraically less than integer_2
		- `-gt`
			- Flag to check if two integer_1 is algebraically greater than integer_2
		- `-eq`
			- Flag to check if two integer_1 is algebraically equal to integer_2
		- `-ne`
			- Flag to check if two integer_1 is algebraically not equal to integer_2
		- `-le`
			- Flag to check if two integer_1 is algebraically less than or equal to integer_2
		- `-ge`
			- Flag to check if two integer_1 is algebraically greater than or equal to integer_2
	- Strings
		- `=`
			- Checks if two strings are identical
		- `!=`
			- Checks if two strings are not identical
	- Files
		- `-f`
			- Flag to check whether a file exists and is a plain file
		- `-d`
			- Flag to check whether a file exists and is a directory
		- `-s`
			- Flag to check whether a file exists and is a plain file of non-zero size

##### Globbing
- It's the expansion of filename patterns
- `*`
	- Matches any number of any character
- `?`
	- Matches any one character
- A list of characters in square brackets
	- Matches any one of them
	- The list of characters in square brackets can also contain ranges, like `a−z`. These can be combined, e.g. `[a−xz]` matches any lower-case letter except 'y'
- A `.` at the beginning of the file name is treated specially: it is only matched explicitly, not by a `*` or `?`
