Signals are a mechanism that allows a process or the operating system to interrupt a currently running process and notify it that an event has occurred. Signals are identified using numbers between `1` and `31`.

The process control block contains a signal table containing pointers to code that will be executed to handle signals. Signal handlers can be installed to modify a signal's behaviour.

The signals `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cannot be modified.

# Modifying Behaviour of Signals
### `struct sigaction`

`sigemptyset`

### `sigaction`

### Signal Handler
The prototype of the signal handler needs to be `void handler(int code);`
That it, it should accept an integer as a parameter and not return anything.
