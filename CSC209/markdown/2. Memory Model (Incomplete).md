# Code
The compiled machine code is stored in the code segment.

---
# Stack
The stack grows upwards and the most recent function call is at the top. Function calls are removed from the stack in the `LIFO` order.  A stack frame is allocated on the stack when a function is invoked so that it can store its arguments and local variables. 

---
# Global Data
Variables declared outside functions are stored in the global data segment, which is right below the code segment. String literals are also stored here.

---
# Heap
The heap grows downwards. Dynamically allocated memory is stored in the heap.
