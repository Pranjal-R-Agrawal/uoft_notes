To the system, all UNIX files appear as simple, unstructured sequences of bytes or characters. The file access primitives provided by the system allow individual bytes to be accessed either sequentially or randomly. Each file is owned by a particular user. Ownership bestows certain rights, such as the ability to change permissions.

UNIX extends the file concept to cover not only normal files, but also peripheral devices and inter-process communication channels. This means that the same primitive system calls can be used to read and write text files, binary files, magnetic tape units and even main memory.

The essential difference between a subroutine and a system call is that when
a program calls a subroutine the code executed is always part of the final object
program, even if it was linked in from a library; with a system calf the major part of
code executed is actually part of the kernel itself and not the calling program.
